# Power Language

This project is building a simple programming language. I'm doing it for three reasons:

1. To learn how programming languages are implemented (at a basic level)
2. To have a tool that will perform linear algebra, with a simple and fast notation.
3. To experiment with Ruby 3 (specifically with the new pattern matching)

## Next Steps

	1. Finish Parser
	2. Build a [word that means thing that runs the AST]
	3. Create a semi-interactable tool. Maybe just able to pipe in files (and pipe out result). Maybe a proper REPL.
